# __Hello from Jennifer Macbeth__
### _cyber security_

I’m driven by a love for solving problems! With a background in Aftersales, I’ve always found joy in finding a solution to complicated problems under tight deadlines. With a skill set in Customer Care, I have a positive and collaborative approach which produces an outcome to the satisfaction of all involved.

I enjoy the coding challenges set on Kaggle, and I’m furthering my tech knowledge via a Cyber Security Course with Co Grammer.
